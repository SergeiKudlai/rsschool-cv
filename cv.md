## About me 
My name is Sergey, I'm 30 years old, my goal is to become a senior FrontEnd developer. 

Of my strengths, I want to emphasize *purposefulness*, *punctuality*, *responsibility*, after completing the layout courses I made projects for my friends and took a couple of freelance orders, but over time I realized that my knowledge was not enough and I should strive to further discover distant shores and learn programming languages ​​and become a master of my own affairs
***
## My skills
I study JavaScript, had experience with HTML, CSS, SCSS, jQuery, GULP, Bootstrap, in my work I used the BEM methodology for naming classes.
***

## JavaScript examples
```
function createPhoneNumber(numbers) {
  let num1 = '';
  let num2 = '';
  let num3 = '';

  numbers.forEach((value, index) => {

    if (index === 0 || index === 1 || index === 2) {
      num1 += value;
    }

    if (index === 3 || index === 4 || index === 5) {
      num2 += value;
    }

    if (index === 6 || index === 7 || index === 8 || index === 9) {
      num3 += value;
    }
  });

  const result = `${num1}) ${num2}-${num3}`

  return result;
}
```
